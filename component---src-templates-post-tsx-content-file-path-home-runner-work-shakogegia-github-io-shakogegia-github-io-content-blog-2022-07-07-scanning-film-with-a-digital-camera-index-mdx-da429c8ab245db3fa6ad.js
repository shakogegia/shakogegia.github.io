The lens does not have any mechanism to focus, so you need to physically change the distance to the subject and get closer or far from it to focus on it. An excellent tool for that is called a "focusing helicoid adapter" to make our life easier. You can find it for different mount types. Still, I find the M42-to-M42 version easiest and cheapest to bye. as it is an M42 mount and the lens has M39, I bought an M39 to M42 adapter wing, which is dirt cheap, and instead of M39 to Sony E adapter, I brought M42 to Sony E adapter.
