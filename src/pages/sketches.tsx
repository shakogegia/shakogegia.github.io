          My love for painting has been a constant in my life, a passion that has stayed with me through the years. Even
          as a child, I remember the thrill of picking up a brush and watching the colors dance across the page, the
          smell of the paint filling my senses. It was as if I had discovered a part of myself that I never knew
          existed, a sense of freedom and joy that I had never before experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I grew older, my love for painting only deepened. I continued to explore different mediums and styles,
          finding solace and creativity in each brushstroke. In 2020, when the world was consumed by the Covid-19
          pandemic and we were all forced to stay at home, I found myself drawn to painting more than ever. I stocked up
          on supplies, filling my shelves with pencils, pens, and paints of every color. I even discovered a new love in
          urban sketching, the art of capturing the world around me in quick, vibrant strokes.
        </p>

          The Netherlands, with its stunning cities and landscapes, is the perfect place for urban sketching. I find
          myself constantly inspired by the people, places, and atmosphere of this country, and I pour that inspiration
          into my art. Each sketch is a moment in time, a memory frozen on paper for all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through painting, I have found a sense of purpose and fulfillment. It is a passion that will always be with
          me, a constant source of joy and creativity. And I will continue to paint, to capture the beauty of the world
          around me and share it with others.
