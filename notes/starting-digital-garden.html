<p>This is what makes me sick of the blogging idea, and I decided to try “digital gardening” instead. Here I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, just as if this was my physical garden. This space, this garden, is all mine. I will try some ideas and write notes about things I like, stuff I explore, and what interests me, regardless of the hobbies I have. Mostly this will touch on programming, books, art, and photography, but these are not the constraints I can't fence; I will share thoughts and notes about anything. This does not preclude me from polishing articles as much as I desire 😎. Remember, this is my garden built for me. As <a href="https://joelhooks.com">Joel Hook</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's my garden, but I'm happy for you to hang around and eat tomatos with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole point of gardening to me is that you can write down ideas you are thinking of and give it the written form of life, which is a big deal, let the others provide you with feedback and thoughts about it, and take it to the next level, develop it.</p>
<p>Of course, there are things to be put in order, but it will be fun to do some gardening in the evening on my iPad in the cafes or the park 👨‍🌾</p></article><div class="mt-14"><em class="font-extralight iAWriterDuospaceItalic text-gray-400">Published on <!-- -->June 2022<!-- --></em></div><div class="py-20"><div class="w-full border-t border-gray-100"></div></div></div></main><footer class="bottom-0 mt-10 text-center w-full py-4 px-6 iAWriterQuattro"><small class="text-gray-500">Copyright © Shalva Gegia 2022.
