I love it since I remember myself. Even my very first memories are about\n          painting. It may sound unbelievable, but I remember myself as a kid in the kindergarten, painting with\n          my friends; This memory is so vivid that I can still feel the smell of the paint and the taste of the paper.\n          It was an easy task, we just had to paint 3 circles: one small, one medium and large one. We used brushes and\n          watercolors, even remember the color I chose - blue. \n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Time has passed since, but I never stopped loving painting. From time to time I've found myself craving for painting.\n          In 2020, when covid ruled the world and everyone was forced to stay at home, I found myself painting more than ever.\n          I've brought brushes, pencils, pens, fountain pens, sketchbooks, watercolors, acrylics, gouache, pastels,\n          and everything I could find at my local art store in Utrecht. But this is not all, I've also bought a\n          art books and now I have a quite a few of them;\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Finally, I ended up with <a href=\"https://urbansketchers.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Urban Sketching</a>, found it as my most\n          favorite art style. I love the idea of sketching the world around me, capturing the moment, the place, the\n          people, the atmosphere. Besides, Netherland is a perfect place for urban sketching.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>Here are some of my recent sketches...</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <p className=\"mb-10 iAWriterDuospaceItalic text-gray-400\">Hera are list of cameras I own:</p>\n\n      <div className=\"\">\n        <Gallery className='object-cover' images={data.allFile.edges.map((edge: any) => edge.node.childImageSharp.fluid.src)} />\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    allFile(\n      sort: {name: ASC},\n      filter: { extension: { regex: \"/(jpg)|(jpeg)|(png)/\" }, sourceInstanceName: { eq: \"sketches\" } }\n    ) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          childImageSharp {\n            fluid(quality: 100) {\n              originalName\n              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n            }\n            gatsbyImageData(placeholder: BLURRED, formats: [AUTO, WEBP, AVIF])\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n"],"names":["Gallery","props","React","className","children","images","map","src","loading","key","classNames","SketchesPage","data","Layout","SEO","title","href","target","allFile","edges","edge","node","childImageSharp","fluid"],"sourceRoot":""}
