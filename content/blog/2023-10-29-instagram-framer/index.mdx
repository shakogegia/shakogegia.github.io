How many times have you wanted to post a photo on Instagram, but you didn't want to crop it to a square?

I've been there too many times, so I decided to create a simple tool to generate frames for your Instagram photos.

Here is a short video recording of the app in action:

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <iframe width="580" height="515" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVfZH9Rs5d4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

I probably spent more time than I should have on this, but I wanted to make it as easy to use as possible.

The app does not require any installation, and images are processed locally in your browser and are not uploaded anywhere.

You can find the app here: [https://instagram-framer.vercel.app/](https://instagram-framer.vercel.app/)

I hope you find it useful, and if you have any feedback, please let me know!

Cheers!
