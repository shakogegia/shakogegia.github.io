Even\n          as a child, I remember the thrill of picking up a brush and watching the colors dance across the page, the\n          smell of the paint filling my senses. It was as if I had discovered a part of myself that I never knew\n          existed, a sense of freedom and joy that I had never before experienced.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          As I grew older, my love for painting only deepened. I continued to explore different mediums and styles,\n          finding solace and creativity in each brushstroke. In 2020, when the world was consumed by the Covid-19\n          pandemic and we were all forced to stay at home, I found myself drawn to painting more than ever. I stocked up\n          on supplies, filling my shelves with pencils, pens, and paints of every color. I even discovered a new love in\n          urban sketching, the art of capturing the world around me in quick, vibrant strokes.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The Netherlands, with its stunning cities and landscapes, is the perfect place for urban sketching. I find\n          myself constantly inspired by the people, places, and atmosphere of this country, and I pour that inspiration\n          into my art. Each sketch is a moment in time, a memory frozen on paper for all eternity.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Through painting, I have found a sense of purpose and fulfillment. It is a passion that will always be with\n          me, a constant source of joy and creativity. And I will continue to paint, to capture the beauty of the world\n          around me and share it with others.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <motion.div\n        className=\"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-2 mt-10\"\n        initial=\"hidden\"\n        animate=\"show\"\n        whileInView=\"show\"\n        viewport={{ once: true }}\n        variants={{\n          hidden: {},\n          show: {\n            transition: {\n              staggerChildren: 0.08,\n            },\n          },\n        }}\n      >\n        {data.allFile.edges.map((edge: any) => (\n          <motion.div\n            key={edge.node.childImageSharp.fluid.src}\n            className=\"flex flex-col gap-8 rounded-md p-4 transition-colors group bg-neutral-50 hover:bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-gray-800 hover:dark:bg-gray-700\"\n            variants={{ hidden: { opacity: 0, y: -10 }, show: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { type: 'spring' } } }}\n          >\n            <img src={edge.node.childImageSharp.fluid.src} className=\"object-contain max-h-60\" />\n          </motion.div>\n        ))}\n      </motion.div>\n\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    allFile(\n      sort: { name: ASC }\n      filter: { extension: { regex: \"/(jpg)|(jpeg)|(png)/\" }, sourceInstanceName: { eq: \"sketches\" } }\n    ) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          childImageSharp {\n            fluid(quality: 100) {\n              originalName\n              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n            }\n            gatsbyImageData(placeholder: BLURRED, formats: [AUTO, WEBP, AVIF])\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n"],"names":["Hero","title","icon","color","className","children","React","classNames","SketchesPage","data","Layout","SEO","motion","initial","animate","whileInView","viewport","once","variants","hidden","show","transition","staggerChildren","allFile","edges","map","edge","key","node","childImageSharp","fluid","src","opacity","y","type"],"sourceRoot":""}
