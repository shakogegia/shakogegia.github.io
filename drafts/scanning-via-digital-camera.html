Sure, it's great fun to have a darkroom and play with silver gelatine prints, but let's face it, we all have Instagram and want to share our work with the rest of the world. If you are lucky enough to have the film scanned at your local lab, great, but prices are going higher and higher, so to get those images on your device, you need some setup to scan them.

Another option is to get a dedicated film scanner from Nikon, Minolta, and others, but they are out of budget for me. So here comes the digital camera scanning setup.</p>
<p>There are a few components of which setup consists of a <a href="#camera"><strong>camera</strong></a>, a <a href="#lens"><strong>lens</strong></a> with macro capability; some <a href="#stand"><strong>stand</strong></a> to hold the camera, a <a href="#film_holder"><strong>film holder</strong></a>, and a <a href="#light_source"><strong>light source</strong></a>. let's break it down each by one</p>
<h4>Camera</h4>
<p>I use cropped sensor mirrorless Sony a6400</p>
<h4>Lens</h4>
<p>Here are a few options, but it needs to be a macro-capable one. One of the most popular options I find is to buy Nikkor 55 ‚®ê2.8 AI-S Micro, which is not a very expensive one and seems to be a good option. But I already own some enlargers and enlarger lenses. I chose the enlarger lens El-Nikkor ‚®ê 2.8, a pretty cheap lens that produces excellent images. The nice thing about the enlarger lens I like is that it's built for projecting flat images, and as our film is also flat (at least it should be üôÉ), this will be a good fit for us.</p>
<p>To mount an enlarger lens on the camera, we need some adapters. The lens itself has an M39 Leica mount (as most the enlarger lenses do), and my camera (Sony a6400) has a Sony E-mount bayonet. You might think that buying M39 to Sony E-mount adapter would do the job, but we are not yet there. The lens does not have any mechanism to focus, so you need to physically change the distance to the subject and get closer or far from it to focus on something. There is an excellent tool for that called a focusing helicoid adapter to make our life easier. You can find it for different mount types. Still, I find the M42-to-M42 version easiest and cheapest to bye. as it is M42 mount and the lens has M39, I bought an M39 to M42 adapter, which is dirt cheap, and instead of M39 to Sony E adapter, I brought M42 to Sony E adapter. this may sound intimidating but it's not.</p>
<p>Another cheap option for easy focusing is to buy some kind of so-called 'Bellows,' which I'll explore later</p>
<p>Here is the final lens mount system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lens El-Nikkor f2.8</li>
<li>M39 to M42 Adapter</li>
<li>M42 to M42 focusing helicoid adapter</li>
<li>M42 to Sony E mount adapter</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stand</h4>
<p>When it comes to stand, first what comes to mind is a tripod, which I have is the cheapest available on market. while it may be somewhat sturdy, legs always get in my way and never really is the comfortable way to use it. also, we need to hold the camera point lens down towards the film and if you don't already possess a really good and flexible one, don't go that way.</p>
<p>other than tripod, copy-stands seemed nice and reliable solution, but copy-stands from Kaiser or other brands can get expensive. so I decided to make one üòé. as I already wrote above, I happen to have Durst enlarger which with easy conversions can be used as a copy-stand.</p>
<h4>Film holder</h4>
<p>Etsy</p>
<h4>Light Source</h4>
<p>Lightbox and iPad, newton rings, diffuser glass</p></article><div class="mt-14"><em class="font-extralight iAWriterDuospaceItalic text-gray-400">Published on <!-- -->June 2022<!-- --></em></div><div class="py-20"><div class="w-full border-t border-gray-100"></div></div></div></main><footer class="bottom-0 mt-10 text-center w-full py-4 px-6 iAWriterQuattro"><small class="text-gray-500">Copyright ¬© Shalva Gegia 2022.
