I discovered the book by accident and liked it very much. Recommend that you read Sci-fi lovers. I will be honest and tell you that my favorite science fiction writer, Philip Dick's similar science fiction writer I have never read before. I think Philip Dick fans will like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impressions of the book followed me for a good long time.

A TV series of the same name is based on this book\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my admiration for this book on Reddit, readers' opinions on this book were quite divided. I have found people like me who admire this book. A few of my friends also read this book and were satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Reddit you can also check out the author's AMA (Ask Me Anything) Blake Crouch AMA where Blake himself answers readers' questions about his books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FODxClmVcAYi5wi?format=jpg\u0026#x26;name=small\"\u003e\n  \u003cem\u003eillustration by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/blakecrouch1/status/1504477293002981381\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHilary Clarcq\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, before dark matter saw the light of day, Sony Pictures acquired the rights to make the film, although the fate of the book's film adaptation is still unknown. There was also the idea to shoot a TV series instead of a movie. The series can be exciting when Jason moves to different worlds and visits alternate worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 11th we will see another book by Blake Crouch - Recursion , which I am sure will be just as entertaining and interesting as \"Dark Matter\"\u003c/p\u003e"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes","query":{},"buildId":"zy28Gzo3m1oemf6gD0O8r","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
