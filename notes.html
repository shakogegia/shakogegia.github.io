<p>Photography is a method of communication that helps us perceive the world that the photographer offers us, to recall a moment from our lives. One can talk about many positive aspects of photography. This is to see the world that you can not reach. Photography - as a hobby, helps you to overcome various personal life crises, helps you to have a goal, and just look at the world from a positive side.</p></article></a></div></div></main><footer class="bottom-0 mt-10 text-center w-full py-4 px-6 iAWriterQuattro"><small class="text-gray-500">Copyright ¬© Shalva Gegia 2022.

Another option is to get a dedicated film scanner from Nikon, Minolta, and others, but people sell them for mental prices and are out of budget for me. So here comes the option of scanning with the digital camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few components of which setup consists are a \u003ca href=\"https://#camera\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecamera\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a \u003ca href=\"https://#lens\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003elens\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e with macro capability; some \u003ca href=\"https://#stand\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003estand\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e to hold the camera, a \u003ca href=\"https://#film_holder\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003efilm holder\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and a \u003ca href=\"https://#light_source\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003elight source\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. let's break it down each by one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCamera\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use cropped sensor mirrorless Sony a6400, but you can use any camera with an interchangeable lens, whether it's DSLR or mirrorless, full-frame, or cropped sensor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eLens\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo me, this is the crucial part. Here we have a few options, but it needs to be a macro-capable one. One of the most popular options is to buy Nikkor 55 ‚®ê2.8 AI-S Micro, which is not very expensive and seems to be a good option, but I already own some enlargers and enlarger lenses. I chose the enlarger lens El-Nikkor ‚®ê 2.8, a cheap lens that produces excellent images. The cool thing about the enlarger lenses is that it's built for projecting flat images and as our film is also flat, or at least it should be üôÉ, this will be a good fit for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo mount an enlarger lens on the camera, we need some adapters. The lens has an M39 Leica mount (as most the enlarger lenses do), and my camera (Sony a6400) has a Sony E-mount bayonet. You might think buying an M39 to Sony E-mount adapter would do the job, but wait for a second; we are not yet there. The lens does not have any mechanism to focus, so you need to physically change the distance to the subject and get closer or far from it to focus on it. An excellent tool for that is called a \"focusing helicoid adapter\" to make our life easier. You can find it for different mount types. Still, I find the M42-to-M42 version easiest and cheapest to bye. as it is an M42 mount and the lens has M39, I bought an M39 to M42 adapter wing, which is dirt cheap, and instead of M39 to Sony E adapter, I brought M42 to Sony E adapter. This whole information may sound intimidating, but it's not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother cheap option for ‚Äúeasy focusing‚Äù and also for macro photography is to buy some kind of so-called 'Bellows,' which I'll explore later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo these are the final lens mount system:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLens El-Nikkor f2.8\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eM39 to M42 Adapter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eM42 to M42 focusing helicoid adapter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eM42 to Sony E mount adapter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://res.craft.do/user/full/c1f660f3-6119-a09b-30f1-aebf482da31b/doc/2F264CB5-8622-4E22-97A1-2DAB1ED64B38/E97EA553-6561-4516-AF95-7CA043074197_2/dxP6kLHWNXzDYghfy0j75yh7Q8odq7IRl3jqtgEvJDIz/373972_01_1000x1000.jpeg\" width=\"180\" alt=\"Lens El-Nikkor f2.8\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://res.craft.do/user/full/c1f660f3-6119-a09b-30f1-aebf482da31b/doc/2F264CB5-8622-4E22-97A1-2DAB1ED64B38/B2ADC36E-770D-42A2-B837-A780EA8F0B49_2/iTokux5ZDNhHeO1mht89RzQlOtlI3HVkhvkNVyaaRPkz/m39m42.jpeg\" width=\"180\" alt=\"M39 to M42 Adapter\"\u003e \n  \u003cimg src=\"https://res.craft.do/user/full/c1f660f3-6119-a09b-30f1-aebf482da31b/doc/2F264CB5-8622-4E22-97A1-2DAB1ED64B38/44FDC1D6-8D81-4431-9D41-19A138F58647_2/x9zBk0O1SYiJ5LCzVAQNba6AK5d4YxvXrUUvpz1Zjqgz/M42-M42-MCR-01_1400x.jpeg\" width=\"180\" alt=\"M42 to M42 focusing helicoid adapter\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://res.craft.do/user/full/c1f660f3-6119-a09b-30f1-aebf482da31b/doc/2F264CB5-8622-4E22-97A1-2DAB1ED64B38/0F1E5C89-81DE-49B6-A5A4-7BD15378E8D7_2/yphvqiNCkhhnv6Zb9ToWXrqsPPFBq1j1hBDpcgPHx4Ez/m42nex.jpeg\" width=\"180\" alt=\"M42 to Sony E mount adapter\"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eStand\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to stand, first what comes to mind is a tripod, which I already own. While it may be somewhat sturdy, legs always get in my way and never really is the comfortable way to use it. Also, we need to hold the camera pointing lens down towards the film, and if you don't already possess a perfect and flexible one, my suggestion would be: don't go that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than a tripod, copy-stands seemed an excellent and reliable solution, but copy-stands from Kaiser or other brands can get expensive. So I decided to make one üòé. as I already wrote above, I happen to have a Durst enlarger which, with easy conversions, can be used as a copy-stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you choose to buy an enlarger as a copy stand, I recommend Durst M601, which I currently use; it has a 3/8\" screw hole, and you can easily mount a tripod ball-head on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother good and more compact alternative is Durst M301 or Durst F30, which sometimes goes cheap on eBay (for 20$).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://res.craft.do/user/full/c1f660f3-6119-a09b-30f1-aebf482da31b/doc/2F264CB5-8622-4E22-97A1-2DAB1ED64B38/8D006530-E9D4-45BC-B435-2553D5023A09_2/z1EBaZ2oCxsQQpJrm3NYxMaesn4vRZLFkbJBh6zaZocz/Xnip2022-07-07_10-30-57.png\" alt=\"Durst M601\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eFilm holder\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have tried to search film holders, you are probably familiar with film holders from Valoi, Negative Supply, Essential Film holders, Lomography Digitalize, and others. Some of them look very neat, sturdy, and a reliable solution but are not particularly cheap. You can also make DIY it at home from cardboard. Alternatively, there are some 3D model files out there (you can google it), and if you have a 3D printer, you can print it or find the 3d print-shop online and order. I discovered my 3D-printed one on Etsy for 30‚Ç¨, it can only hold 35mm film, but that's enough for me. It's small and affordable, not super great, but usable, and it does its job.

I discovered the book by accident and liked it very much. Recommend that you read Sci-fi lovers. I will be honest and tell fyou that this book and in general Blake's books reminded me of my all-time favorite science fiction writer, Philip Dick, and never read books more similar before in terms of style. I think Philip Dick fans will like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impressions of the book followed me for a good long time.

I went out to shoot. At such times you can not and do not think about problems, you forget that something is bothering you and will not let you down, you are just full of enthusiasm and you want to catch more and more shots. You do not think about time, you do not think about the place, you go and in anticipation of something interesting your face fills with a childish smile again when you look with a completely different eye at something you have not noticed before even though you saw it every day. When you return home, you will quickly look at the pictures taken and if at least 1-2 are \"The photo\",\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many more things, between heaven and earth, than are dreamt of in your philosophy, Horatio.\u003cbr\u003e\n‚ÄîShakespeare,¬†\u003cem\u003eHamlet\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even decided to do some research on visual arts and health and how Art Therapy affects general health. The article cites an example of a study of a group of people undergoing chemotherapy. Some of them were busy with art, some were not. It turned out that those who were associated with any kind of art (music, sculpture, photography, etc.) were in a much less stressful state and more positive despite their difficult situation.
