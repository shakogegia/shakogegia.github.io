<p>Photography is a method of communication that helps us perceive the world that the photographer offers us, to recall a moment from our lives. One can talk about many positive aspects of photography. This is to see the world that you can not reach. Photography - as a hobby, helps you to overcome various personal life crises, helps you to have a goal, and just look at the world from a positive side.</p></article></a></div></div></main><footer class="bottom-0 mt-10 text-center w-full py-4 px-6 iAWriterQuattro"><small class="text-gray-500">Copyright ¬© Shalva Gegia 2022.

Here I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, just as if this was my physical garden. This space, this garden, is all mine. I will try some ideas and write notes about things I like, stuff I explore, and what interests me, regardless of the hobbies I have. Mostly this will touch on programming, books, art, and photography, but these are not the constraints I can't fence; I will share thoughts and notes about anything. This does not preclude me from polishing articles as much as I desire üòé. Remember, this is my garden built for me.

I discovered the book by accident and liked it very much. Recommend that you read Sci-fi lovers. I will be honest and tell fyou that this book and in general Blake's books reminded me of my all-time favorite science fiction writer, Philip Dick, and never read books more similar before in terms of style. I think Philip Dick fans will like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impressions of the book followed me for a good long time.

At such times you can not and do not think about problems, you forget that something is bothering you and will not let you down, you are just full of enthusiasm and you want to catch more and more shots. You do not think about time, you do not think about the place, you go and in anticipation of something interesting your face fills with a childish smile again when you look with a completely different eye at something you have not noticed before even though you saw it every day.
