Even\n          as a child, I remember the thrill of picking up a brush and watching the colors dance across the page, the\n          smell of the paint filling my senses. It was as if I had discovered a part of myself that I never knew\n          existed, a sense of freedom and joy that I had never before experienced.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          As I grew older, my love for painting only deepened. I continued to explore different mediums and styles,\n          finding solace and creativity in each brushstroke. In 2020, when the world was consumed by the Covid-19\n          pandemic and we were all forced to stay at home, I found myself drawn to painting more than ever. I stocked up\n          on supplies, filling my shelves with pencils, pens, and paints of every color. I even discovered a new love in\n          urban sketching, the art of capturing the world around me in quick, vibrant strokes.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The Netherlands, with its stunning cities and landscapes, is the perfect place for urban sketching. I find\n          myself constantly inspired by the people, places, and atmosphere of this country, and I pour that inspiration\n          into my art. Each sketch is a moment in time, a memory frozen on paper for all eternity.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Through painting, I have found a sense of purpose and fulfillment. It is a passion that will always be with\n          me, a constant source of joy and creativity. And I will continue to paint, to capture the beauty of the world\n          around me and share it with others.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <p className=\"mb-10 iAWriterDuospaceItalic text-gray-400\">Here are some of my recent sketches...</p>\n\n      <div className=\"\">\n        <Gallery\n          className=\"object-cover\"\n          images={data.allFile.edges.map((edge: any) => edge.node.childImageSharp.fluid.src)}\n        />\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    allFile(\n      sort: { name: ASC }\n      filter: { extension: { regex: \"/(jpg)|(jpeg)|(png)/\" }, sourceInstanceName: { eq: \"sketches\" } }\n    ) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          childImageSharp {\n            fluid(quality: 100) {\n              originalName\n              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n            }\n            gatsbyImageData(placeholder: BLURRED, formats: [AUTO, WEBP, AVIF])\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n"],"names":["Gallery","props","React","className","children","images","map","src","loading","key","classNames","SketchesPage","data","Layout","SEO","title","allFile","edges","edge","node","childImageSharp","fluid"],"sourceRoot":""}
